## Odd Even  Problem

Create two threads with the following behavior:

- One thread prints **odd numbers** from 1 to 9.
- The other thread prints **even numbers** from 2 to 10.

The output should be **alternating in sequence**, such as:

```
1 printed by odd printer  
2 printed by even printer  
3 printed by odd printer  
4 printed by even printer  
5 printed by odd printer  
6 printed by even printer  
7 printed by odd printer  
8 printed by even printer  
9 printed by odd printer  
10 printed by even printer
```

> Ensure that the numbers are printed in the correct alternating order using proper synchronization between the threads.
